#### UK Gender Pay Gap Analysis
In a group project, two students and I performed data cleaning in python on three datasets (approximately about 27,000 values) collected from a United Kingdom open-source database with a small team to conduct extensive exploratory analysis. Utilizing matplotlib and seaborn to observe and create visualizations, we identified patterns significant to gender pay disparities across a wide range of UK companies and industries from 2018 to 2021. 

After research and analysis, we produced a comprehensive report that meticulously documented the code, analysis methodologies, and actionable conclusions, providing a solid foundation for further research and policy-making initiatives.

#### 2021 UK Gender Pay Gap
Independently performed simple data exploration and data visualization to create a visually compelling story about the gender pay disparity in the United Kingdom for 2021 using R and data visualization techniques, such as ggplot2, dplyr, and a geocode API.
